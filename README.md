# svg2movie

With the power of headless browser, we can easily create a movie from SVG animations.
See this [YouTube video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoT0BlR-kTo) for any references, as this is the source of the code.

# Installation

```
$ npm install
```

# How to use?

Place your SVG animation inside the index.html, and make some adjustment. And then you can run this with this line of command:
```
$ node convert.js
```
or shortcut:
```
$ npm run convert
```
or alternatively:
```
$ npx convert
```
